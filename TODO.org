* Housekeeping
** Add Travis CI
** Improve "Getting Started" in the wiki
*** and then link to it from the README

* Entity API
** Add default values to attributes
** Support cardinality/many
*** Probably use an array or set to store values
*** Must retract values removed from the array
** People probably want validations by default: include ActiveModel::Validations

* Persistence API
** Handle Java exceptions in the Peer persistence library
** Handle exceptions from the REST client in the REST persistence library
** Refactor so that Diametric::Persistence is the primary module and the connection determines different behavior
*** Yoko requests: .connect should take an argument :rest or :peer, #peer? and #rest? methods should be on the connection object

* History API
** Make it
